This Arduino project uses a photoresistor to measure light intensity and control three LEDs (green, yellow, red) based on the environment. In automatic mode, the system dynamically adjusts light intensity thresholds, activating LEDs for different light levels (green for low, yellow for medium, red for high). In manual mode, users can set custom thresholds via serial commands. The Serial Monitor displays light intensity, active LED, and environment (cloudy, normal, bright sunlight).
